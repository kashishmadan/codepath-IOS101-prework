## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favourite apps
1. LinkedIn
    - Reactions when liking a post
    - Schedule a call with someone from the chat box directly
2. Instagram
    - Stories expire in 24 hours
    - Creating and editing reels
3. Zomato
    - Live Activities in iOS lock screen
    - Dining vs Delivery navigation and ease of use

App Idea: I would like to work on an app that helps ease collaboration between friends and classmates. Note sharing, discussions, study groups, study meetups, are some of the features I hope to add to the application.


## Notes
No challenges as such! Instructions were pretty clear.
